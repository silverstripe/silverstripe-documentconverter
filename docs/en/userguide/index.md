# Document Converter

The Document Converter module enables users to import a tree structure of pages, from sections and headings in a Microsoft Word document. It is ideal for when you want to quickly populate your website from your existing document resources.

## Usage

Whether the document converter options will appear on your website it depends on how it has been set up. For this manual we will assume the conversion has been allowed globally.

Please note that the import process will replace the content of the page your are importing to, and it also has a licence to remove and replace all its children. It will still be possible to get the content back from the version history of the CMS, but it's good to keep that in mind.

If you upload the document straight away the simplest scenario will be executed:

 * The content of the main page will be replaced by the imported markup
 * The original document will be removed afterwards
 * The page will remain in draft mode for you to preview the output
 * All images that came with the document will be stored in the top level directory of the assets
